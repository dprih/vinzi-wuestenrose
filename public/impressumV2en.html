<h2 id="einleitung-ueberblick-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We have written this privacy policy (version 02.07.2021-121769686) in order to explain to you, in accordance with the provisions of the <a class="adsimple-121769686" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&amp%3Btid=%5Badsimpletextid]" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a> and applicable national laws, which personal data (data for short) we as the controller – and the processors commissioned by us (e.g. providers) – process, will process in the future and what legal options you have. The terms used are to be considered as gender-neutral.<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">In short:</strong> We provide you with comprehensive information about any personal data we process about you.</p>
<p>Privacy policies usually sound very technical and use legal terminology. However, this privacy policy is intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as possible. So long as it aids transparency, technical <strong class="adsimple-121769686">terms are explained in a reader-friendly manner, links</strong> to further information are provided and <strong class="adsimple-121769686">graphics</strong> are used. We are thus informing in clear and simple language that we only process personal data in the context of our business activities if there is a legal basis for it. This is certainly not possible with brief, unclear and legal-technical statements, as is often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection. I hope you find the following explanations interesting and informative. Maybe you will also find some information that you have not been familiar with.<br />
If you still have questions, we would like to ask you to contact the responsible body named below or in the imprint, to follow the existing links and to look at further information on third-party sites. You can of course also find our contact details in the imprint.</p>
<h2 id="anwendungsbereich-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Scope</h2>
<p>This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by our company and to all personal data processed by companies commissioned by us (processors). With the term personal data, we refer to information within the meaning of Article 4 No. 1 GDPR, such as the name, email address and postal address of a person. The processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and invoice our services and products, be it online or offline. The scope of this privacy policy includes:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-121769686">
<li class="adsimple-121769686">all online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Social media presences and email communication</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">mobile apps for smartphones and other devices</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">In short:</strong> This privacy policy applies to all areas in which personal data is processed in a structured manner by the company via the channels mentioned. Should we enter into legal relations with you outside of these channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.</p>
<h2 id="rechtsgrundlagen-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Legal bases</h2>
<p>In the following privacy policy, we provide you with transparent information on the legal principles and regulations, i.e. the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, which enable us to process personal data.<br />
Whenever EU law is concerned, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of April 27, 2016. You can of course access the General Data Protection Regulation of the EU online at EUR-Lex, the gateway to EU law, at <a class="adsimple-121769686" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&tid=121769686" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679</a>.</p>
<p>We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:</p>
<ol>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Consent</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR): You have given us your consent to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be the storage of data you entered into a contact form.</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Contract</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. b GDPR): We process your data in order to fulfill a contract or pre-contractual obligations with you. For example, if we conclude a sales contract with you, we need personal information in advance.</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Legal obligation</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR): If we are subject to a legal obligation, we will process your data. For example, we are legally required to keep invoices for our bookkeeping. These usually contain personal data.</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Legitimate interests</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR): In the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict your basic rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we have to process certain data in order to be able to operate our website securely and economically. Therefore, the processing is a legitimate interest.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other conditions such as making recordings in the interest of the public, the exercise of official authority as well as the protection of vital interests do not usually occur with us. Should such a legal basis be relevant, it will be disclosed in the appropriate place.</p>
<p>In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-121769686">
<li class="adsimple-121769686">In <strong class="adsimple-121769686">Austria</strong> this is the Austrian Data Protection Act (<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Datenschutzgesetz</strong>), in short <strong class="adsimple-121769686">DSG</strong>.</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">In <strong class="adsimple-121769686">Germany</strong> this is the Federal Data Protection Act (<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Bundesdatenschutzgesetz</strong>), in short <strong class="adsimple-121769686">BDSG</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should other regional or national laws apply, we will inform you about them in the following sections.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="speicherdauer-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Storage Period</h2>
<p>It is a general criterion for us to store personal data only for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products. This means that we delete personal data as soon as any reason for the data processing no longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to keep certain data stored even after the original purpose no longer exists, such as for accounting purposes.</p>
<p>If you want your data to be deleted or if you want to revoke your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted as soon as possible, provided there is no obligation to continue its storage.</p>
<p>We will inform you below about the specific duration of the respective data processing, provided we have further information.</p>
<h2 id="rechte-dsgvo-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Rights in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation</h2>
<p>According to Article 13 of the GDPR, you have the following rights to ensure your data is processed fairly and transparently:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-121769686">
<li class="adsimple-121769686">According to Article 15 of the GDPR, you have a right to information as to whether we are processing your data. If this is the case, you have the right to receive a copy of the data in question, as well as the following information:
<ul class="adsimple-121769686">
<li class="adsimple-121769686">the purpose of the processing;</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">the categories of personal data concerned;</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">the recipients to whom the personal data is disclosed, and in particular how security can be guaranteed if the data is transferred to third countries;</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">how long the data will be stored;</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">the existence of the right to request rectification, erasure or restriction of processing of personal data and the right to object to such processing;</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (you can find links to these authorities below);</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">the source of the data, if we have not collected it from you directly;</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">whether profiling is carried out, i.e. whether data is automatically evaluated in order to be allocated to a personal profile on you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">According to Article 16 of the GDPR, you have the right to request rectification of the data, which means that we have to correct your data should you find any errors.</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">According to Article 17 of the GDPR, you have the right to have your personal data erased (the “right to be forgotten”), which specifically means that you can request to have your data deleted.</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">According to Article 18 of the GDPR, you have the right to obtain restriction of processing, which means that we are only allowed to store the data but no longer use or process it.</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">According to Article 20 of the GDPR, you have the right to request data portability, which means that on request, we will provide you with your data in a common format.</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">According to Article 21 of the GDPR, you have a right to object, which will result in a change in processing after implementation.
<ul class="adsimple-121769686">
<li class="adsimple-121769686">If the processing of your data is based on Article 6 (1) (e) (public interest, exercise of official authority) or Article 6 (1) (f) (legitimate interest), you can object to the processing. We will then check as soon as possible, whether we can legally comply with this objection.</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">If data is used to operate direct mail, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We will then no longer be allowed to use your data for direct marketing purposes.</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">If your data is used for profiling, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We will then no longer be allowed to use your data for profiling purposes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">According to Article 22 of the GDPR, you may have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (including profiling).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe that the processing of your data violates the data protection law, or your data protection claims have been violated in any other way, you can complain to the supervisory authority. For Austria this is the Data Protection Authority, whose website you can find at <a class="adsimple-121769686" href="https://www.data-protection-authority.gv.at/?tid=121769686" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://www.data-protection-authority.gv.at/</a> and for Germany you can contact the <a class="adsimple-121769686" class="121769686" href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI)</a>.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">In short: </strong>You have rights – do not hesitate to contact our responsible person or authority listed above!</p>
<h2 id="datenuebertragung-drittlaender-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Data transfer to third countries</h2>
<p>We only transfer or process data to countries outside the EU (third countries) if you consent to this processing, if this is required by law or if it is contractually necessary. In any case, we generally only do so to the permitted extent. In most cases, your consent is the most important reason for data being processed in third countries. When personal data is being processed in third countries such as the USA, where many software manufacturers offer their services and have their servers located, your personal data may be processed and stored in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>We want to expressly point out, that according to the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfer to the USA. Data processing by US services (such as Google Analytics) may result in data processing and retention without the data having undergone anonymisation processes. Furthermore, US government authorities may be able to access individual data. The collected data may also get linked to data from other services of the same provider, should you have a user account with the respective provider. We try to use server locations within the EU, whenever this is offered and possible.</p>
<p>We will provide you with more details about data transfer to third countries in the appropriate sections of this privacy policy, whenever applicable.</p>
<h2 id="sicherheit-datenverarbeitung-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Security of data processing operations</h2>
<p>In order to protect personal data, we have implemented both technical and organisational measures. We encrypt or pseudonymise personal data wherever this is possible. Thus, we make it as difficult as we can for third parties to extract personal information from our data.</p>
<p>Article 25 of the GDPR refers to “data protection by technical design and by data protection-friendly default” which means that both software (e.g. forms) and hardware (e.g. access to server rooms) appropriate safeguards and security measures shall always be placed. If applicable, we will outline the specific measures below.</p>
<h2 id="tls-verschluesselung-https-en" class="adsimple-121769686">TLS encryption with https</h2>
<p>The terms TLS, encryption and https sound very technical, which they are indeed. We use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to securely transfer data on the Internet.<br />
This means that the entire transmission of all data from your browser to our web server is secured – nobody can “listen in”.</p>
<p>We have thus introduced an additional layer of security and meet data protection requirements through technical measures <a class="adsimple-121769686" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN&tid=121769686" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Article 25 Section 1 GDPR</a>). With the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is an encryption protocol for safe data transfer on the internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential information.<br />
You can recognise the use of this safeguarding tool by the little lock-symbol <img role="img" src="https://www.adsimple.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/schlosssymbol-https-211141072.svg" width="17" height="18" />, which is situated in your browser’s top left corner in the left of the internet address (e.g. examplepage.uk), as well as by the display of the letters https (instead of http) as a part of our web address.<br />
If you want to know more about encryption, we recommend you to do a Google search for “Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure wiki” to find useful links with further information.</p>
<h2 id="kommunikation-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Communications</h2>
<p>If you contact us and communicate with us via phone, email or online form, your personal data may be processed.</p>
<p>The data will be processed for handling and processing your request and for the related business transaction. The data is stored for this period of time or for as long as is legally required.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Affected persons</h3>
<p>The above-mentioned processes affect all those who seek contact with us via the communication channels we provide.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Telephone</h3>
<p>When you call us, the call data is stored in pseudonymised form on the respective terminal device, as well as by the telecommunications provider that is being used. In addition, data such as your name and telephone number may be sent via email and stored for answering your inquiries. The data will be erased as soon as the business case has ended and the legal requirements allow for its erasure.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Email</h3>
<p>If you communicate with us via email, your data is stored on the respective terminal device (computer, laptop, smartphone, …) as well as on the email server. The data will be deleted as soon as the business case has ended and the legal requirements allow for its erasure.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Online forms</h3>
<p>If you communicate with us using an online form, your data is stored on our web server and, if necessary, forwarded to our email address. The data will be erased as soon as the business case has ended and the legal requirements allow for its erasure.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Legal bases</h3>
<p>Data processing is based on the following legal bases:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-121769686">
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent): You give us your consent to store your data and to continue to use it for the purposes of the business case;</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR (contract): For the performance of a contract with you or a processor such as a telephone provider, or if we have to process the data for pre-contractual activities, such as preparing an offer;</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests): We want to conduct our customer inquiries and business communication in a professional manner. Thus, certain technical facilities such email programs, Exchange servers and mobile network operators are necessary to efficiently operate our communications.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="webhosting-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Web hosting</h2>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What is web hosting?</h3>
<p>Every time you visit a website nowadays, certain information – including personal data – is automatically created and stored, including on this website. This data should be processed as sparingly as possible, and only with good reason. By website, we mean the entirety of all websites on your domain, i.e. everything from the homepage to the very last subpage (like this one here). By domain we mean example.uk or examplepage.com.</p>
<p>When you want to view a website on a screen, you use a program called a web browser. You probably know the names of some web browsers: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.</p>
<p>The web browser has to connect to another computer which stores the website’s code: the web server. Operating a web server is complicated and time-consuming, which is why this is usually done by professional providers. They offer web hosting and thus ensure the reliable and flawless storage of website data.</p>
<p>Whenever the browser on your computer establishes a connection (desktop, laptop, smartphone) and whenever data is being transferred to and from the web server, personal data may be processed. After all, your computer stores data, and the web server also has to retain the data for a period of time in order to ensure it can operate properly.</p>
<p>As an illustration:</p>
<p>
<img role="img" src="https://www.adsimple.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/browser-und-webserver.svg" alt="Browser and web server" width="100% " />
</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Why do we process personal data?</h3>
<p>The purposes of data processing are:</p>
<ol>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Professional hosting of the website and operational security</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">To maintain the operational as well as IT security</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Anonymous evaluation of access patterns to improve our offer, and if necessary, for prosecution or the pursuit of claims.li></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Which data are processed?</h3>
<p>Even while you are visiting our website, our web server, that is the computer on which this website is saved, usually automatically saves data such as</p>
<ul class="adsimple-121769686">
<li class="adsimple-121769686">the full address (URL) of the accessed website (e. g. https://www.examplepage.uk/examplesubpage.html?tid=121769686)</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">browser and browser version (e.g. Chrome 87)</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">the operating system used (e.g. Windows 10)</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">the address (URL) of the previously visited page (referrer URL) (e. g. https://www.examplepage.uk/icamefromhere.html/)</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">the host name and the IP address of the device from the website is being accessed from (e.g. COMPUTERNAME and 194.23.43.121)</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">date and time</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">in so-called web server log files</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">How long is the data stored?</h3>
<p>Generally, the data mentioned above are stored for two weeks and are then automatically deleted. We do not pass these data on to others, but we cannot rule out the possibility that this data may be viewed by the authorities in the event of illegal conduct.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">In short:</strong> Your visit is logged by our provider (company that runs our website on special computers (servers)), but we do not pass on your data without your consent!</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Legal basis</h3>
<p>The lawfulness of processing personal data in the context of web hosting is justified in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (safeguarding of legitimate interests), as the use of professional hosting with a provider is necessary to present the company in a safe and user-friendly manner on the internet, as well as to have the ability to track any attacks and claims, if necessary.</p>
<h2 id="cookies-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Cookies</h2>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What are cookies?</h3>
<p>Our website uses HTTP-cookies to store user-specific data.<br />
In the following we explain what cookies are and why they are used, so that you can better understand the following privacy policy.</p>
<p>Whenever you surf the Internet, you are using a browser. Common browsers are for example, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text-files in your browser. These files are called cookies.</p>
<p>It is important to note that cookies are very useful little helpers. Almost every website uses cookies. More precisely, these are HTTP cookies, as there are also other cookies for other uses. HTTP cookies are small files that our website stores on your computer. These cookie files are automatically placed into the cookie-folder, which is the “brain” of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. Moreover, to define a cookie, one or multiple attributes must be specified.</p>
<p>Cookies store certain user data about you, such as language or personal page settings. When you re-open our website to visit again, your browser submits these “user-related” information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are familiar to. In some browsers, each cookie has its own file, while in others, such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in one single file.</p>
<p>The following graphic shows a possible interaction between a web browser such as Chrome and the web server. The web browser requests a website and receives a cookie back from the server. The browser then uses this again as soon as another page is requested.</p>
<p>
<img role="img" src="https://www.adsimple.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/http-cookie-interaction.svg" alt="HTTP cookie interaction between browser and web server" width="100%" />
</p>
<p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our site, while third-party cookies are created by partner-websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Each cookie must be evaluated individually, as each cookie stores different data. The expiry time of a cookie also varies from a few minutes to a few years. Cookies are not software programs and do not contain viruses, trojans or other malware. Cookies also cannot access your PC’s information.</p>
<p>This is an example of how cookie-files can look:</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Name:</strong> _ga<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Value:</strong> GA1.2.1326744211.152121769686-9<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Purpose:</strong> Differentiation between website visitors<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Expiry date:</strong> after 2 years</p>
<p>A browser should support these minimum sizes:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-121769686">
<li class="adsimple-121769686">At least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">At least 50 cookies per domain</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">At least 3000 cookies in total</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Which types of cookies are there?</h3>
<p>The exact cookies that we use, depend on the used services, which will be outlined in the following sections of this privacy policy. Firstly, we will briefly focus on the different types of HTTP-cookies.</p>
<p>There are 4 different types of cookies:</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686"> Essential cookies<br />
</strong> These cookies are necessary to ensure the basic functions of a website. They are needed when a user for example puts a product into their shopping cart, then continues surfing on different websites and comes back later in order to proceed to the checkout. These cookies ensure the shopping cart does not get deleted, even if the user closes their browser window.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686"> Purposive cookies<br />
</strong> These cookies collect information about user behaviour and whether the user receives any error messages. Furthermore, these cookies record the website’s loading time as well as its behaviour in different browsers.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686"> Target-orientated cookies<br />
</strong> These cookies ensure better user-friendliness. Thus, information such as previously entered locations, fonts sizes or data in forms stay stored.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686"> Advertising cookies<br />
</strong>These cookies are also known as targeting cookies. They serve the purpose of delivering customised advertisements to the user. This can be very practical, but also rather annoying.</p>
<p>Upon your first visit to a website you are usually asked which of these cookie-types you want to accept. Furthermore, this decision will of course also be stored in a cookie.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about cookies and do not mind technical documentation, we recommend <a class="adsimple-121769686" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265</a>, the Request for Comments of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called “HTTP State Management Mechanism”.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Purpose of processing via cookies</h3>
<p>The purpose ultimately depends on the respective cookie. You can find out more details below or from the software manufacturer that sets the cookie.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Which data are processed?</h3>
<p>Cookies are little helpers for a wide variety of tasks. Unfortunately, it is not possible to tell which data is generally stored in cookies, but in the privacy policy below we will inform you on what data is processed or stored.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Storage period of cookies</h3>
<p>The storage period depends on the respective cookie and is further specified below. Some cookies are erased after less than an hour, while others can remain on a computer for several years.</p>
<p>You can also influence the storage duration yourself. You can manually erase all cookies at any time in your browser (also see “Right of objection” below). Furthermore, the latest instance cookies based on consent will be erased is after you withdraw your consent. The legality of storage will remain unaffected until then.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Right of objection – how can I erase cookies?</h3>
<p>You can decide for yourself how and whether you want to use cookies. Regardless of which service or website the cookies originate from, you always have the option of erasing, deactivating or only partially accepting cookies. You can for example block third-party cookies but allow all other cookies.</p>
<p>If you want to find out which cookies have been stored in your browser, or if you want to change or erase cookie settings, you can find this option in your browser settings:</p>

</p>
<p>If you generally do not want cookies, you can set up your browser in a way to notify you whenever a cookie is about to be set. This gives you the opportunity to manually decide to either permit or deny the placement of every single cookie. This procedure varies depending on the browser. Therefore, it might be best for you to search for the instructions in Google. If you are using Chrome, you could for example put the search term “delete cookies Chrome” or “deactivate cookies Chrome” into Google.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Legal basis</h3>
<p>The so-called “cookie directive” has existed since 2009. It states that the storage of cookies requires your <strong class="adsimple-121769686">consent</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR). Within countries of the EU, however, the reactions to these guidelines still vary greatly. In Austria, however, this directive was implemented in Section 96 (3) of the Telecommunications Act (TKG). In Germany, the cookie guidelines have not been implemented as national law. Instead, this guideline was largely implemented in Section 15 (3) of the Telemedia Act (TMG).</p>
<p>For absolutely necessary cookies, even if no consent has been given, there are legitimate interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR), which in most cases are of an economic nature. We want to offer our visitors a pleasant user experience on our website. For this, certain cookies often are absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>This is exclusively done with your consent, unless absolutely necessary cookies are used. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (a) of the GDPR.</p>
<p>In the following sections you will find more detail on the use of cookies, provided the used software does use cookies.</p>

</h2>
<h2 id="facebook-pixel-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Facebook Pixel Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We use Facebook’s Facebook pixel on our website. For that, we have implemented a code on our website. The Facebook pixel is a segment of a JavaScript code, which, in case you arrived on our website via Facebook ads, loads an array or functions that enable Facebook to track your user actions. For example, if you buy a product on our website, the Facebook pixel is triggered and then saves your actions on our website in one or more cookies. These cookies enable Facebook to match your user data (customer data such as IP address, user ID) with the data of your Facebook account. After that, Facebook deletes your data again. The collected data is anonymous as well as inaccessible and can only be used for ad placement purposes. If you are a Facebook user and you are logged in, your visit to our website is automatically assigned to your Facebook user account.</p>
<p>We exclusively want to show our products or services to persons, who are interested in them. With the aid of the Facebook pixel, our advertising measures can get better adjusted to your wishes and interests. Therefore, Facebook users get to see suitable advertisement (if they allowed personalised advertisement). Moreover, Facebook uses the collected data for analytical purposes and for its own advertisements.</p>
<p>In the following we will show you the cookies, which were set on a test page through the integration of the Facebook pixel. Please consider that these cookies are only examples. Depending on the interaction that is made on our website, different cookies are set.</p>

<h2 id="google-analytics-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Google Analytics Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We use the tracking and analysis tool Google Analytics (GA) of the US-American company Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). Google Analytics collects data on your actions on our website. Whenever you click a link for example, this action is saved in a cookie and transferred to Google Analytics. With the help of reports which we receive from Google Analytics, we can adapt our website and our services better to your wishes. In the following, we will explain the tracking tool in more detail, and most of all, we will inform you what data is saved and how you can prevent this.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What is Google Analytics?</h3>
<p>Google Analytics is a tracking tool with the purpose of conducting data traffic analysis of our website. For Google Analytics to work, there is a tracking code integrated to our website. Upon your visit to our website, this code records various actions you perform on your website. As soon as you leave our website, this data is sent to the Google Analytics server, where it is stored.</p>
<p>Google processes this data and we then receive reports on your user behaviour. These reports can be one of the following:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-121769686">
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Target audience reports: With the help of target audience reports we can get to know our users better and can therefore better understand who is interested in our service.</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Advertising reports: Through advertising reports we can analyse our online advertising better and hence improve it.</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Acquisition reports: Acquisition reports provide us helpful information on how we can get more people enthusiastic about our service.</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Behaviour reports: With these reports, we can find out how you interact with our website. By the means of behaviour reports, we can understand what path you go on our website and what links you click.</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Conversion reports: A conversion is the process of leading you to carry out a desired action due to a marketing message. An example of this would be transforming you from a mere website visitor into a buyer or a newsletter subscriber. Hence, with the help of these reports we can see in more detail, if our marketing measures are successful with you. Our aim is to increase our conversion rate.</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Real time reports: With the help of these reports we can see in real time, what happens on our website. It makes us for example see, we can see how many users are reading this text right now.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Why do we use Google Analytics on our website?</h3>
<p>The objective of our website is clear: We want to offer you the best possible service. Google Analytics’ statistics and data help us with reaching this goal.</p>
<p>Statistically evaluated data give us a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of our website. On the one hand, we can optimise our page in a way, that makes it easier to be found by interested people on Google. On the other hand, the data helps us to get a better understanding of you as our visitor. Therefore, we can very accurately find out what we must improve on our website, in order to offer you the best possible service. The analysis of that data also enables us to carry out our advertising and marketing measures in a more individual and more cost-effective way. After all, it only makes sense to show our products and services exclusively to people who are interested in them.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What data gets stored by Google Analytics?</h3>
<p>With the aid of a tracking code, Google Analytics creates a random, unique ID which is connected to your browser cookie. That way, Google Analytics recognises you as a new user. The next time you visit our site, you will be recognised as a “recurring” user. All data that is collected gets saved together with this very user ID. Only this is how it is made possible for us to evaluate and analyse pseudonymous user profiles.</p>
<p>Your interactions on our website are measures by tags such as cookies and app instance IDs. Interactions are all kinds of actions that you perform on our website. If you are also using other Google systems (such as a Google Account), data generated by Google Analytics can be linked with third-party cookies. Google does not pass on any Google Analytics data, unless we as the website owners authorise it. In case it is required by law, exceptions can occur.</p>
<p>The following cookies are used by Google Analytics:</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Name:</strong> _ga<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Value:</strong>2.1326744211.152121769686-5<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Purpose:</strong> By deafault, analytics.js uses the cookie _ga, to save the user ID. It generally serves the purpose of differenciating between website visitors.<br />

<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Note:</strong> This list is by no means exhaustive, since Google are repeatedly changing the use of their cookies.</p>
<p>Below we will give you an overview of the most important data that can be evaluated by Google Analytics:</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Heatmaps:</strong> Google creates so-called Heatmaps an. These Heatmaps make it possible to see the exact areas you click on, so we can get information on what routes you make on our website.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Session duration:</strong> Google calls the time you spend on our website without leaving it session duration. Whenever you are inactive for 20 minutes, the session ends automatically.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Bounce rate</strong> If you only look at one page of our website and then leave our website again, it is called a bounce.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Account creation:</strong> If you create an account or make an order on our website, Google Analytics collects this data.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">IP-Address:</strong> The IP address is only shown in a shortened form, to make it impossible to clearly allocate it.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Location:</strong> Your approximate location and the country you are in can be defined by the IP address. This process is called IP location determination.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Technical information:</strong> Information about your browser type, your internet provider and your screen resolution are called technical information.</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Source:</strong> Both, Google Analytics as well as ourselves, are interested what website or what advertisement led you to our site.</p>
<p>Further possibly stored data includes contact data, potential reviews, playing media (e.g. when you play a video on our site), sharing of contents via social media or adding our site to your favourites. This list is not exhaustive and only serves as general guidance on Google Analytics’ data retention.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">How long and where is the data saved?</h3>
<p>Google has servers across the globe. Most of them are in America and therefore your data is mainly saved on American servers. Here you can read detailed information on where Google’s data centres are located: <a class="adsimple-121769686" href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en</a>
</p>
<p>Your data is allocated to various physical data mediums. This has the advantage of allowing to retrieve the data faster, and of protecting it better from manipulation. Every Google data centre has respective emergency programs for your data. Hence, in case of a hardware failure at Google or a server error due to natural disasters, the risk for a service interruption stays relatively low.</p>
<p>Google Analytics has a 26 months standardised period of retaining your user data. After this time, your user data is deleted. However, we have the possibility to choose the retention period of user data ourselves. There are the following five options:</p>

<h2 id="ionos-webanalytics-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121769686">IONOS WebAnalytics Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We use the analysis tool IONOS WebAnalytics by the German company 1&1 IONOS SE, Elgendorfer Straße 57, 56410 Montabaur, Germany on our website. The tool helps us to analyse our website. For this, data is collected and stored. However, this tool does not collect any data that could identify you as a person. Nevertheless, in this privacy policy we will give you more detailed information on the processing and storage of your data and explain why we use IONOS WebAnalytics.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What is IONOS WebAnalytics?</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, IONOS WebAnalytics is a tool that is used to analyse our website. The software program collects data such as how long you have been on our website, what buttons you click or which website has led you to us. Frankly, this gives us a good overview of the user behaviour on our website. This information is fully anonymous. Meaning, that with this data we cannot identify you as a person, and only receive general usage information and statistics.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Why do we use IONOS WebAnalytics on our website?</h3>
<p>It is our goal to provide you the best possible experience on our website. We are confident of our offers and want our website to be a helpful and useful place for you. To ensure this, we have to adapt our website to your needs and wishes as well as we can. A web analysis tool such as IONOS WebAnalytics and the data it provides can improve our website accordingly. Furthermore, the collected data can also be useful to us for making our advertising and marketing measures more individual. However, with all these web analyses, the protection of your personal data is important to us. Unlike other analysis tools, IONOS WebAnalytics does not store or process any data that could identify you as a person.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Which data are stored by IONOS WebAnalytics?</h3>
<p>Your data are collected and stored using log files or a so-called pixel. A pixel is a snippet of JavaScript code that loads various functions which can be used for tracking user behaviour. WebAnalytics deliberately refrains from using cookies.</p>
<p>IONOS does not retain any of your personal data. When you access a page, your IP address is transmitted, but is then immediately anonymised and processed in a way that makes it impossible to identify you as a person.</p>
<p>The following data are stored by IONOS WebAnalytics:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-121769686">
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Your browser type and version</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">which website you visited before (referrer)</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">which specific site you have accessed on our website</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">which operating system you are using</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">which device you are using (PC, tablet or smartphone)</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">when you accessed our site</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Your anonymised IP address</li>
</ul>
<p>These data are not forwarded to any third party providers and are only used for statistical evaluations.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">How long and where are the data stored?</h3>
<p>The data will be stored until our contract with IONOS WebAnalytics expires. With a regular web hosting tariff, the data will be stored in our log directory, which will generate graphical statistics. These logs are deleted every 8 weeks. With a MyWebsite tariff, the data is identified by a pixel. In this case, the data is only stored and processed internally at IONOS WebAnalytics.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
<p>Generally, you reserve the right to information, correction or deletion and restriction of the processing of your personal data at any time. Moreover, you can revoke your consent to the processing of your data anytime. However, it is not possible to delete this data since IONOS WebAnalytics neither stores or processes any of your personal data, nor any data that could be assigned to you as a person.</p>
<p>We hope we could provide you with the most important information on IONOS WebAnalytics’ rather sparing data processing. If you want to learn more about the tracking service, we recommend you to read the company’s privacy policy at <a class="adsimple-121769686" href="https://www.ionos.co.uk/help/online-marketing/siteanalytics/information-collected-in-siteanalytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ionos.co.uk/help/online-marketing/siteanalytics/information-collected-in-siteanalytics/?tid=121769686</a>.</p>

</h2>
<h2 id="facebook-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Facebook Data Policy</h2>
<p>We use selected Facebook tools on our website. Facebook is a social media network of the company Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland. With the aid of this tool we can provide the best possible offers to you and anyone interested in our products and services. In the following we will give you an overview on the different Facebook tools, as well as on what data is sent to Facebook and how you can delete these data.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What are Facebook tools?</h3>
<p>Along with many other products, Facebook also offers so called “Facebook Business Tools”. This is Facebook’s official name for the tools, but it is not very common. Therefore, we decided to merely call them “Facebook tools”. They include the following:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-121769686">
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Facebook-Pixel</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">social plugins (e.g. the “Like” or “Share“ button)</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Facebook Login</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Account Kit</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">APIs (application programming interface)</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">SDKs (Softwart developmept kits)</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Plattform-integrations</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Plugins</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Codes</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Specifications</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Documentations</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Technologies and Services</li>
</ul>
<p>With these tools Facebook can extend its services and is able to receive information on user activities outside of Facebook.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Why do we use Facebook tools on our website?</h3>
<p>We only want to show our services and products to people who are genuinely interested in them. With the help of advertisements (Facebook Ads) we can reach exactly these people. However, to be able to show suitable adverts to users, Facebook requires additional information on people’s needs and wishes. Therefore, information on the user behaviour (and contact details) on our website, are provided to Facebook. Consequently, Facebook can collect better user data and is able to display suitable adverts for our products or services. Thanks to the tools it is possible to create targeted, customised ad campaigns of Facebook.</p>
<p>Facebook calls data about your behaviour on our website “event data” and uses them for analytics services. That way, Facebook can create “campaign reports” about our ad campaigns’ effectiveness on our behalf. Moreover, by analyses we can get a better insight in how you use our services, our website or our products. Therefore, some of these tools help us optimise your user experience on our website. With the social plugins for instance, you can share our site’s contents directly on Facebook.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What data is saved by the Facebook tools?</h3>
<p>With the use of the Facebook tools, personal data (customer data) may be sent to Facebook. Depending on the tools used, customer data such as name, address, telephone number and IP address may be transmitted.</p>
<p>Facebook uses this information to match the data with the data it has on you (if you are a Facebook member). However, before the customer data is transferred to Facebook, a so called “Hashing” takes place. This means, that a data record of any size is transformed into a string of characters, which also has the purpose of encrypting data.</p>
<p>Moreover, not only contact data, but also “event data“ is transferred. These data are the information we receive about you on our website. To give an example, it allows us to see what subpages you visit or what products you buy from us. Facebook does not disclose the obtained information to third parties (such as advertisers), unless the company has an explicit permission or is legally obliged to do so. Also, “event data“ can be linked to contact information, which helps Facebook to offer improved, customised adverts. Finally, after the previously mentioned matching process, Facebook deletes the contact data.</p>
<p>To deliver optimised advertisements, Facebook only uses event data, if they have been combined with other data (that have been collected by Facebook in other ways). Facebook also uses event data for the purposes of security, protection, development and research. Many of these data are transmitted to Facebook via cookies. Cookies are little text files, that are used for storing data or information in browsers. Depending on the tools used, and on whether you are a Facebook member, a different number of cookies are placed in your browser. In the descriptions of the individual Facebook tools we will go into more detail on Facebook cookies. You can also find general information about the use of Facebook cookies at <a class="adsimple-121769686" href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies?tid=121769686" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies</a>.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">How long and where are the data saved?</h3>
<p>Facebook fundamentally stores data, until they are no longer of use for their own services and products. Facebook has servers for storing their data all around the world. However, customer data is cleared within 48 hours after they have been matched with their own user data.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
<p>In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) you have the right of information, rectification, transfer and deletion of your data.</p>
<p>The collected data is only fully deleted, when you delete your entire Facebook account. Deleting your Facebook account works as follows:</p>
<p>1) Click on settings in the top right side in Facebook.</p>
<p>2) Then, click “Your Facebook information“ in the left column.</p>
<p>3) Now click on “Deactivation and deletion”.</p>
<p>4) Choose “Permanently delete account“ and then click on “Continue to account deletion“.</p>
<p>5) Enter your password, click on “continue“ and then on “Delete account“.</p>
<p>The retention of data Facebook receives via our site is done via cookies (e.g. with social plugins), among others. You can deactivate, clear or manage both all and individual cookies in your browser. How this can be done differs depending on the browser you use. The following instructions show, how to manage cookies in your browser:</p>

<h2 id="facebook-soziale-plug-ins-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Facebook Social Plugins Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We installed so-called social plugins from Facebook Inc. to our website. You can recognise these buttons by the classic Facebook logo, the “Like” button (hand with raised thumb) or by a “Facebook plugin” label. A social plugin is a small part of Facebook that is integrated into our page. Each plugin has its own function. The most used functions are the well-known “Like” and “Share” buttons.</p>
<p>Facebook offers the following social plugins:</p>
<ul class="adsimple-121769686">
<li class="adsimple-121769686">“Save” button</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">“Like” button, Share, Send and Quote</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Page plugin</li>
<li class="adsimple-121769686">Comments</li>

On the one hand, we use the social plug-ins to offer you a better user experience on our site, and on the other hand because Facebook can optimise our advertisements with it.</p>
<p>If you have a Facebook account or have already visited <a class="adsimple-121769686" href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">facebook.com</a>, Facebook has already placed at least one cookie in your browser. In this case, your browser sends information to Facebook via this cookie as soon as you visit our website or interact with social plugins (e.g. the “Like” button).</p>
<p>The received information will be deleted or anonymised within 90 days. According to Facebook, this data includes your IP address, the websites you have visited, the date, time and other information relating to your browser.</p>
<p>In order to prevent Facebook from collecting much data and matching it with your Facebook data during your visit to our website, you must log out of Facebook while you visit our website.</p>
<p>If you are not logged in to Facebook or do not have a Facebook account, your browser sends less information to Facebook because you have fewer Facebook cookies. Nevertheless, data such as your IP address or which website you are visiting can be transmitted to Facebook. We would like to explicitly point out that we do not know what exact data is collected. However, based on our current knowledge, we want to try informing you as best we can about data processing.

<h2 id="instagram-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Instagram Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We have integrated functions of Instagram to our website. Instagram is a social media platform of the company Instagram LLC, 1601 Willow Rd, Menlo Park CA 94025, USA. Since 2012, Instagram is a subsidiary company of Facebook Inc. and is a part of Facebook’s products. The inclusion of Instagram’s contents on our website is called embedding. With this, we can show you Instagram contents such as buttons, photos or videos directly on our website. If you open websites of our online presence, that have an integrated Instagram function, data gets transmitted to, as well as stored and processed by Instagram. Instagram uses the same systems and technologies as Facebook. Therefore, your data will be processed across all Facebook firms.</p>
<p>In the following, we want to give you a more detailed insight on why Instagram collects data, what data these are and how you can control data processing. As Instagram belongs to Facebook Inc., we have, on the one hand received this information from the Instagram guidelines, and on the other hand from Facebook’s Data Policy.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What is Instagram?</h3>
<p>Instagram is one of the most famous social media networks worldwide. Instagram combines the benefits of a blog with the benefits of audio-visual platforms such as YouTube or Vimeo. To “Insta“ (how the platform is casually called by many users) you can upload photos and short videos, edit them with different filters and also share them to other social networks. Also, if you do not want to be active on Instagram yourself, you can just follow other interesting users.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Why do we use Instagram on our website?</h3>
<p>Instagram is a social media platform whose success has skyrocketed within recent years. Naturally, we have also reacted to this boom. We want you to feel as comfortable as possible on our website. Therefore, we attach great importance to diversified contents. With the embedded Instagram features we can enrich our content with helpful, funny or exciting Instagram contents. Since Instagram is a subsidiary company of Facebook, the collected data can also serve us for customised advertising on Facebook. Hence, only persons who are genuinely interested in our products or services can see our ads.</p>
<p>Instagram also uses the collected data for tracking and analysis purposes. We receive summarised statistics and therefore more insight to your wishes and interests. It is important to mention that these reports do not identify you personally.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What data is saved by Instagram?</h3>
<p>Whenever you land on one of our sites, which have Instagram functions (i.e. Instagram photos or plugins) integrated to them, your browser automatically connects with Instagram’s servers. Thereby, data is sent to, as well as saved and processed by Instagram. This always happens, whether you have an Instagram account or not. Moreover, it includes information on our website, your computer, your purchases, the advertisements you see and on how you use our offer. The date and time of your interaction is also stored. If you have an Instagram account or are logged in, Instagram saves significantly more data on you.</p>
<p>Facebook distinguishes between customer data and event data. We assume this is also the case for Instagram. Customer data are for example names, addresses, phone numbers and IP addresses. These data are only transmitted to Instagram, if they have been “hashed” first. Thereby, a set of data is transformed into a string of characters, which encrypts any contact data. Moreover, the aforementioned “event data“ (data on your user behaviour) is transmitted as well. It is also possible, that contact data may get combined with event data. The collected data data is matched with any data Instagram already has on you.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the gathered data are transferred to Facebook via little text files (cookies) which usually get set in your browser. Depending on the Instagram function used, and whether you have an Instagram account yourself, the amount of data that gets stored varies.</p>
<p>We assume data processing on Instagram works the same way as on Facebook. Therefore, if you have an account on Instagram or have visited <a class="adsimple-121769686" href="http://www.instagram.com?tid=121769686" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.instagram.com</a>, Instagram has set at least one cookie. If this is the case, your browser uses the cookie to send information to Instagram, as soon as you come across an Instagram function. No later than 90 days (after matching) the data is deleted or anonymised. Even though we have studied Instagram’s data processing in-depth, we cannot tell for sure what exact data Instagram collects and retains.</p>
<p>In the following we will show you a list of the least cookies placed in your browser when click on an Instagram function (e.g. button or an Insta picture). In our test we assume you do not have an Instagram account, since if you would be logged in to your Instagram account, your browser would place significantly more cookies.<br />
The following cookies were used in our test:</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Name: </strong>csrftoken<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Value: </strong>“”<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121769686"> Purpose: </strong>This cookie is most likely set for security reasons to prevent falsifications of requests. We could not find out more information on it.<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121769686"> Expiry date:</strong> after one year</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Name: </strong>mid<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121769686"> Value: </strong>“”<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Purpose: </strong>Instagram places this cookie to optimise its own offers and services in- and outside of Instagram. The cookie allocates a unique user ID.<br />

<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">How long and where are these data stored?</h3>
<p>Instagram shares the information obtained within the Facebook businesses with external partners and persons you are globally connected with. Data processing is done according to Facebook’s internal data policy. Your data is distributed to Facebook’s servers across the world, partially for security reasons. Most of these servers are in the USA.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
<p>Thanks to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right of information, rectification, transfer and deletion of your data. Furthermore, you can manage your data in Instagram’s settings. If you want to delete your data on Instagram completely, you will have to delete your Instagram account permanently.</p>
<p>And this is how an Instagram account can be deleted:</p>
<p>First, open the Instagram app. Then, navigate to your profile page, select the three bars in the top right, choose “Settings” and then click “Help”. Now, you will be redirected to the company’s website, where you must click on “Managing Your Account” and then “Delete Your Account”.</p>
<p>When you delete your account completely, Instagram deletes posts such as your photos and status updates. Any information other people shared about you are not a part of your account and do therefore not get deleted.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, Instagram primarily stores your data via cookies. You can manage, deactivate or delete these cookies in your browser. Depending on your browser, managing them varies a bit. We will show you the instructions of the most relevant browsers here.</p>

<h2 id="linkedin-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121769686">LinkedIn Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>On our website we use social plugins from the social media network LinkedIn, of the LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Social plugins can be feeds, content sharing or a link to our LinkedIn page. Social plugins are clearly marked with the well-known LinkedIn logo and for example allow sharing interesting content directly via our website. Moreover, LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company Wilton Place in Dublin is responsible for data processing in the European Economic Area and Switzerland.</p>
<p>By embedding these plugins, data can be sent to, as well as stored and processed by LinkedIn. In this privacy policy we want to inform you what data this is, how the network uses this data and how you can manage or prevent data retention.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What is LinkedIn?</h3>
<p>LinkedIn is the largest social network for business contacts. In contrast to e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn focuses exclusively on establishing business connections. Therefore, companies can present services and products on the platform and establish business relationships. Many people also use LinkedIn to find a job or to find suitable employees for their own company. In Germany alone, the network has over 11 million members. In Austria there are about 1.3 million.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Why do we use LinkedIn on our website?</h3>
<p>We know how busy you are. You just cannot keep up with following every single social media channel. Even if it would really be worth it, as it is with our channels, since we keep posting interesting news and articles worth spreading. Therefore, on our website we have created the opportunity to share interesting content directly on LinkedIn, or to refer directly to our LinkedIn page. We consider built-in social plugins as an extended service on our website. The data LinkedIn collects also help us to display potential advertising measures only to people who are interested in our offer.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What data are stored by LinkedIn?</h3>
<p>LinkedIn stores no personal data due to the mere integration of social plugins. LinkedIn calls the data generated by plugins passive impressions. However, if you click on a social plugin to e.g. share our content, the platform stores personal data as so-called “active impressions”. This happens regardless of whether you have a LinkedIn account or not. If you are logged in, the collected data will be assigned to your account.</p>
<p>When you interact with our plugins, your browser establishes a direct connection to LinkedIn’s servers. Through that, the company logs various usage data. These may include your IP address, login data, device information or information about your internet or cellular provider. If you use LinkedIn services via your smartphone, your location may also be identified (after you have given permission). Moreover, LinkedIn can share these data with third-party advertisers in “hashed” form. Hashing means that a data set is transformed into a character string. This allows data to be encrypted, which prevents persons from getting identified.</p>
<p>Most data on of your user behaviour is stored in cookies. These are small text files that usually get placed in your browser. Furthermore, LinkedIn can also use web beacons, pixel tags, display tags and other device recognitions.</p>
<p>Various tests also show which cookies are set when a user interacts with a social plug-in. We do not claim for the information we found to be exhaustive, as it only serves as an example. The following cookies were set without being logged in to LinkedIn:</p>

<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">How long and where are the data stored?</h3>
<p>In general, LinkedIn retains your personal data for as long as the company considers it necessary for providing its services. However, LinkedIn deletes your personal data when you delete your account. In some exceptional cases, LinkedIn keeps some summarised and anonymised data, even account deletions. As soon as you delete your account, it may take up to a day until other people can no longer see your data. LinkedIn generally deletes the data within 30 days. However, LinkedIn retains data if it is necessary for legal reasons. Also, data that can no longer be assigned to any person remains stored even after the account is closed. The data are stored on various servers in America and presumably also in Europe.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
<p>You have the right to access and delete your personal data at any time. In your LinkedIn account you can manage, change and delete your data. Moreover, you can request a copy of your personal data from LinkedIn.</p>
<p>How to access account data in your LinkedIn profile:</p>
<p>In LinkedIn, click on your profile icon and select the “Settings & Privacy” section. Now click on “Privacy” and then on the section “How LinkedIn uses your data on”. Then, click “Change” in the row with “Manage your data and activity”. There you can instantly view selected data on your web activity and your account history.</p>
<p>In your browser you also have the option of preventing data processing by LinkedIn. As mentioned above, LinkedIn stores most data via cookies that are placed in your browser. You can manage, deactivate or delete these cookies. Depending on which browser you have, these settings work a little different. You can find the instructions for the most common browsers here:</p>

<h2 id="twitter-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Twitter Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We have incorporated Twitter functions on our website. These are, for example, embedded tweets, timelines, buttons or hashtags. Twitter is a short message service and social media platform from the firm Twitter Inc., One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street, Dublin 2 D02 AX07, Ireland.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, in the European Economic Area and Switzerland, a mere integration of the Twitter function does not transfer any personal data or data about your web activities to Twitter. Only when you interact with the Twitter functions, such as by clicking a button, data could be sent to Twitter and get saved as well as processed there. We have no influence on this processing of data and do not bare any responsibility for it. Within this privacy statement, we want to give you an overview of what data Twitter stores, what Twitter does with this data and how you can largely protect yourself from data transmission.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What is Twitter?</h3>
<p>For some, Twitter is a news service, for others, a social media platform, and for others still it is a microblogging service. All these terms are justified and mean pretty much the same.</p>
<p>Both individuals as well as companies use Twitter for communicating with interested people via short messages. Twitter only allows 280 characters per message. These messages are called “tweets”. In contrast to Facebook, for example, the service does not focus on the expansion of a network of “friends”, but strives to be regarded as an open, worldwide news platform. On Twitter you can also have an anonymous account and tweets can be deleted by both, either the company or the users themselves.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Why do we use Twitter on our website?</h3>
<p>Like many other websites and companies, we try to use different channels for offering our services and communicating with our customers. Twitter is a truly useful “small” news service, which is why it has grown dear to us. We regularly tweet or retweet exciting, funny or interesting content. We understand that you do not have the time to follow every channel after channel, as you surely have enough other things to do. That is why we also have integrated Twitter functions to our website. That way, you can experience our Twitter activities “on site” or come to our Twitter page via a direct link. With the integration, we want to strengthen the service and user-friendliness on our website.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What data is stored by Twitter?</h3>
<p>You will find integrated Twitter functions on some of our subpages. If you interact with Twitter content, such as by clicking a button, Twitter may collect and save data. This can happen even if you don’t have a Twitter account yourself. Twitter calls this data “log data”. It includes demographic data, browser cookie IDs, your smartphone’s ID, hashed email addresses, and information on which pages you have visited on Twitter and what actions you have taken there. Of course, Twitter stores more data if you have a Twitter account and are logged in. This retention is usually done via cookies. Cookies are small text files that are usually set in your browser and transmit various information to Twitter.</p>
<p>We will now show you which cookies are placed if you are not logged in to Twitter but visit a website with built-in Twitter functions. Please consider this list as an example. We do not claim for this list to be extensive, since the array of cookies always changes and depends on your individual actions with Twitter content.<br />
The following cookies have been used in our test:</p>

<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Note: </strong>Twitter also works with third parties. Therefore, we have recognized the three Google Analytics cookies _ga, _gat, _gid in our test.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Twitter uses the collected data for gaining better understand on user behaviour, and thus to improve their own services and advertising offers. On the other hand, the data are also used for internal security measures.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">How long and where are the data stored?</h3>
<p>When Twitter collects data from other websites, after a maximum of 30 days, they will be deleted, summarized or otherwise concealed. Twitter’s servers are in various server centres in the United States. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the gathered data will be collected and stored in America. In our research we could not clearly determine whether Twitter also owns servers in Europe. Generally, Twitter may keep collected data stored until either the data are no longer useful to the company, until you delete the data or until a potential legal deletion period has been reached.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
<p>In their Privacy Policy, Twitter repeatedly emphasize that they do not save data from external website visits, provided you or your browser are in the European Economic Area or Switzerland. However, if you interact directly with Twitter, the company will of course store your data.</p>
<p>If you have a Twitter account, you can manage your data by clicking on “More” under the “Profile” button. Then click on “Settings and privacy”. Here you can manage data processing individually.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Twitter account, you can go to <a class="adsimple-121769686" href="https://twitter.com/">twitter.com</a> and click “Settings”. At “Personalization and data” you can manage data that is collected on you.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, most data are stored via cookies, which you can manage, deactivate or delete in your browser. Please note that when changing cookie settings in your browser, the edits will only affect that very browser. This means that if you use another browser in the future, you will have to manage your cookie settings there again. In the following you will find instructions for managing cookies in the most popular browsers.</p>

<h2 id="youtube-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121769686">YouTube Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We have integrated YouTube videos to our website. Therefore, we can show you interesting videos directly on our site. YouTube is a video portal, which has been a subsidiary company of Google LLC since 2006. The video portal is operated by YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. When you visit a page on our website that contains an embedded YouTube video, your browser automatically connects to the servers of YouTube or Google. Thereby, certain data are transferred (depending on the settings). Google is responsible for YouTube’s data processing and therefore Google’s data protection applies.</p>
<p>In the following we will explain in more detail which data is processed, why we have integrated YouTube videos and how you can manage or clear your data.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What is YouTube?</h3>
<p>On YouTube, users can watch, rate, comment or upload videos for free. Over the past few years, YouTube has become one of the most important social media channels worldwide. For us to be able to display videos on our website, YouTube provides a code snippet that we have integrated to our website.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Why do we use YouTube videos on our website?</h3>
<p>YouTube is the video platform with the most visitors and best content. We strive to offer you the best possible user experience on our website, which of course includes interesting videos. With the help of our embedded videos, we can provide you other helpful content in addition to our texts and images. Additionally, embedded videos make it easier for our website to be found on the Google search engine. Moreover, if we place ads via Google Ads, Google only shows these ads to people who are interested in our offers, thanks to the collected data.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What data is stored by YouTube?</h3>
<p>As soon as you visit one of our pages with an integrated YouTube, YouTube places at least one cookie that stores your IP address and our URL. If you are logged into your YouTube account, by using cookies YouTube can usually associate your interactions on our website with your profile. This includes data such as session duration, bounce rate, approximate location, technical information such as browser type, screen resolution or your Internet provider. Additional data can include contact details, potential ratings, shared content via social media or YouTube videos you added to your favourites.</p>
<p>If you are not logged in to a Google or YouTube account, Google stores data with a unique identifier linked to your device, browser or app. Thereby, e.g. your preferred language setting is maintained. However, many interaction data cannot be saved since less cookies are set.</p>
<p>In the following list we show you cookies that were placed in the browser during a test. On the one hand, we show cookies that were set without being logged into a YouTube account. On the other hand, we show you what cookies were placed while being logged in. We do not claim for this list to be exhaustive, as user data always depend on how you interact with YouTube.</p>

<p>The data YouTube receive and process on you are stored on Google’s servers. Most of these servers are in America. At <a class="adsimple-121769686" href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en</a> you can see where Google’s data centres are located. Your data is distributed across the servers. Therefore, the data can be retrieved quicker and is better protected against manipulation.</p>
<p>Google stores collected data for different periods of time. You can delete some data anytime, while other data are automatically deleted after a certain time, and still other data are stored by Google for a long time. Some data (such as elements on “My activity”, photos, documents or products) that are saved in your Google account are stored until you delete them. Moreover, you can delete some data associated with your device, browser, or app, even if you are not signed into a Google Account.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
<p>Generally, you can delete data manually in your Google account. Furthermore, in 2019 an automatic deletion of location and activity data was introduced. Depending on what you decide on, it deletes stored information either after 3 or 18 months.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you have a Google account or not, you can set your browser to delete or deactivate cookies placed by Google. These settings vary depending on the browser you use. The following instructions will show how to manage cookies in your browser:</p>

<p>If you generally do not want to allow any cookies, you can set your browser to always notify you when a cookie is about to be set.

If you want to learn more about how your data is handled, we recommend the privacy policy at <a class="adsimple-121769686" href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a>.</p>
<h2 id="google-maps-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Google Maps Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>On our website we use Google Maps of the company Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). With the use of Google Maps, we can show you locations in a better way and can therefore adjust our service to your needs. Due to the utilisation of Google Maps, data gets transferred to Google and is saved on Google’s servers. In the following, we want to explain in detail what Google Maps is, why we use this Google service, what data is stored and how you can prevent this.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What is Google Maps?</h3>
<p>Google Maps is an internet maps service of the company Google Inc. With Google Maps you can search for exact locations of cities, sights, accommodations or businesses online via a PC, a tablet or an app. If businesses are represented on Google My Business, the respective location as well as other information about the company are shown there. In order to show route directions, a location’s map sections can be integrated in a website through a HTML-code. Google Maps depicts the earth’s surface as either a road map or as air and satellite images. Due to the street view and high-quality satellite images, it is possible for exact representations to be made.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Why do we use Google Maps on our website?</h3>
<p>The efforts we make on this page have the goal of giving you a useful and meaningful experience on our website. Through the integration of Google Maps, we can offer you essential information on various locations. Therefore, you can spot our office address with one glance. Furthermore, the route directions always show you the best and fastest way to us. You can retrieve the route directions for traveling either by car, by public transport, on foot or by bike. The integration of Google Maps is a part of our customer service.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What data is stored by Google Maps?</h3>
<p>For Google Maps to offer its full services, the company must collect and store your data. This includes your entered search terms, your IP-address as well as your longitude and latitude coordinates. When you use the route-planner function, the entered start address is stored also. However, this data retention happens on Google Maps‘ websites. We can only inform you about it but cannot influence it in any way. Since we have included Google Maps on our website, Google will set at least one cookie (Name: NID) into your browser. This cookie saves data on your user behaviour. Google primarily uses this data to optimise ist own services and to provide you with individual, personalised advertisements.</p>
<p>The following cookies are set in your browser due to the integration of Google Maps:</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Name:</strong> NID<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Value:</strong> 188=h26c1Ktha7fCQTx8rXgLyATyITJ121769686-5<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Purpose:</strong> Google uses NID in order to adjust advertisments to your Google searches. With the cookie’s help Google “remembers“ your most frequently entered search queries or your previous interaction with ads. That way you always receive customised adertisments. The cookie contains a unique ID, wich Google uses to collect your personal settings for advertising porposes.<br />
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Expiration date:</strong> after 6 months</p>
<p>
<strong class="adsimple-121769686">Note:</strong> We cannot guarantee completeness of the information on saved data. This is, because especially concerning the use of cookies, changes can happen anytime. To identify the cookie NID, a test page was created, to which Google Maps was included.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">How long and where is the data saved?</h3>
<p>There are Google servers in data centres across the entire planet. However, most servers are in America. For this reason, your data is widely stored in the USA. Here you can read in detail about where the Google servers are located: <a class="adsimple-121769686" href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en</a>
</p>
<p>Google distributes data to various data carriers. This makes it possible to retrieve the data faster and to better protect it from possible attempted manipulations. Every server has emergency programs. Thus, should for example a problem with Google’s hardware occur or should a natural disaster impact the servers, any data will quite certainly stay protected.</p>
<p>Moreover, Google saves some data for a specified period. With some other data on the other hand, Google only offers the opportunity for deleting it manually. Furthermore, the company anonymises information (e.g. advertising data) in server logs, by deleting a part of the IP-address and cookie information after 9 to 18 months.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">How can I delete my data, or prevent data retention?</h3>
<p>Due to the automatic delete function for location and activity data, which was introduced in 2019, information that is used for determining your location and web or app activity is saved for either 3 or 18 months, depending on your preferred decision, and is deleted thereafter.<br />
Furthermore, it is possible to delete this data manually from your browser history via your Google account anytime. If you want to prevent the determination of your location altogether, you must pause the category “Web and app activity” in your Google account. Click on “Data and personalisation” and then choose the option “Activity controls”. Here you can switch the activities on or off.</p>
<p>Moreover, in your browser you can deactivate, delete or manage individual cookies. This function can differ a little, depending on what browser you are using. The following instructions will show you how to manage cookies in your browser:</p>

<h2 id="google-fonts-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121769686">Google Fonts Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>On our website we use Google Fonts, from the company Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA).</p>
<p>To use Google Fonts, you must log in and set up a password. Furthermore, no cookies will be saved in your browser. The data (CSS, Fonts) will be requested via the Google domains fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com. According to Google, all requests for CSS and fonts are fully separated from any other Google services. If you have a Google account, you do not need to worry that your Google account details are transmitted to Google while you use Google Fonts. Google records the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) as well as the utilised fonts and stores these data securely. We will have a detailed look at how exactly the data storage works.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">What are Google Fonts?</h3>
<p>Google Fonts (previously Google Web Fonts) is a list of over 800 fonts which href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google?tid=121769686”>Google LLC provides its users for free.</p>
<p>Many of these fonts have been published under the SIL Open Font License license, while others have been published under the Apache license. Both are free software licenses.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Why do we use Google Fonts on our website?</h3>
<p>With Google Fonts we can use different fonts on our website and do not have to upload them to our own server. Google Fonts is an important element which helps to keep the quality of our website high. All Google fonts are automatically optimised for the web, which saves data volume and is an advantage especially for the use of mobile terminal devices. When you use our website, the low data size provides fast loading times. Moreover, Google Fonts are secure Web Fonts. Various image synthesis systems (rendering) can lead to errors in different browsers, operating systems and mobile terminal devices. These errors could optically distort parts of texts or entire websites. Due to the fast Content Delivery Network (CDN) there are no cross-platform issues with Google Fonts. All common browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera) are supported by Google Fonts, and it reliably operates on most modern mobile operating systems, including Android 2.2+ and iOS 4.2+ (iPhone, iPad, iPod). We also use Google Fonts for presenting our entire online service as pleasantly and as uniformly as possible.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">Which data is saved by Google?</h3>
<p>Whenever you visit our website, the fonts are reloaded by a Google server. Through this external cue, data gets transferred to Google’s servers. Therefore, this makes Google recognise that you (or your IP-address) is visiting our website. The Google Fonts API was developed to reduce the usage, storage and gathering of end user data to the minimum needed for the proper depiction of fonts. What is more, API stands for „Application Programming Interface“ and works as a software data intermediary.</p>
<p>Google Fonts stores CSS and font requests safely with Google, and therefore it is protected. Using its collected usage figures, Google can determine how popular the individual fonts are. Google publishes the results on internal analysis pages, such as Google Analytics. Moreover, Google also utilises data of ist own web crawler, in order to determine which websites are using Google fonts. This data is published in Google Fonts’ BigQuery database. Enterpreneurs and developers use Google’s webservice BigQuery to be able to inspect and move big volumes of data.</p>
<p>One more thing that should be considered, is that every request for Google Fonts automatically transmits information such as language preferences, IP address, browser version, as well as the browser’s screen resolution and name to Google’s servers. It cannot be clearly identified if this data is saved, as Google has not directly declared it.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">How long and where is the data stored?</h3>
<p>Google saves requests for CSS assets for one day in a tag on their servers, which are primarily located outside of the EU. This makes it possible for us to use the fonts by means of a Google stylesheet. With the help of a stylesheet, e.g. designs or fonts of a website can get changed swiftly and easily.</p>
<p>Any font related data is stored with Google for one year. This is because Google’s aim is to fundamentally boost websites’ loading times. With millions of websites referring to the same fonts, they are buffered after the first visit and instantly reappear on any other websites that are visited thereafter. Sometimes Google updates font files to either reduce the data sizes, increase the language coverage or to improve the design.</p>
<h3 class="adsimple-121769686">How can I delete my data or prevent it being stored?</h3>
<p>The data Google stores for either a day or a year cannot be deleted easily. Upon opening the page this data is automatically transmitted to Google. In order to clear the data ahead of time, you have to contact Google’s support at <a class="adsimple-121769686" href="https://support.google.com/?hl=en-GB&tid=121769686">https://support.google.com/?hl=en-GB&tid=121769686</a>. The only way for you to prevent the retention of your data is by not visiting our website.</p>
<p>Unlike other web fonts, Google offers us unrestricted access to all its fonts. Thus, we have a vast sea of font types at our disposal, which helps us to get the most out of our website. You can find out more answers and information on Google Fonts at <a class="adsimple-121769686" href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=121769686">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=121769686</a>. While Google does address relevant elements on data protection at this link, it does not contain any detailed information on data retention.<br />
It proofs rather difficult to receive any precise information on stored data by Google.</p>
